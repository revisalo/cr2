Python Dictionary Example
</H2>

<P>
In order to provide a gentle introduction to our interfaces, the
examples so far have demonstrated only very basic capabilities.  We
will now attempt to demonstrate some of the power of our Python
interface by describing a more complex example.  This example is
intended to capture most of the common ingredients of large, complex
optimization models.  Implementing this same example in another API
would most likely have required hundreds of lines of code (ours is
around 70 lines of Python code).

<P>
We'll need to present a few preliminaries before getting to the
example itself.  You'll need to learn a bit about the Python language,
and we'll need to describe a few custom classes and functions.  Our
intent is that you will come away from this section with an
appreciation for the power and flexibility of this interface.  It can
be used to create quite complex models using what we believe are very
concise and natural modeling constructs.  Our goal with this interface
has been to provide something that feels more like a mathematical
modeling language than a programming language API.

<P>
If you'd like to dig a bit deeper into the Python language constructs
described here, we recommend that you visit the
<A NAME="tex2html29"
  HREF="http://docs.python.org/release/2.7.2/tutorial/">online Python
  tutorial</A>.

<P>
<B>Motivation</B>

<P>
At the heart of any optimization model lies a set of decision
variables.  Finding a convenient way to store and access these
variables can often represent the main challenge in implementing the
model.  While the variables in some models map naturally to simple
programming language constructs (e.g., <EM>x[i]</EM> for contiguous
integer values <EM>i</EM>), other models can present a much greater
challenge.  For example, consider a model that optimizes the flow of
multiple different commodities through a supply network.  You might
have a variable <EM>x['Pens', 'Denver', 'New York']</EM> that
captures the flow of a manufactured item (pens in this example) from
Denver to New York.  At the same time, you might <EM>not</EM> want to
have a variable <EM>x['Pencils', 'Denver', 'Seattle']</EM>, since not all
combinations of commodities, source cities, and destination cities
represent valid paths through the network.  Representing a sparse set
of decision variables in a typical programming language can
be cumbersome.

<P>
To compound the challenge, you typically need to build constraints
that involve subsets of these decision variables.  For example, in our
network flow model you might want to put an upper bound on the total
flow that enters a particular city.  You could certainly collect the
relevant decision variables by iterating over all possible cities and
selecting only those variables that capture possible flow from that
source city into the desired destination city.  However, this is
clearly wasteful if not all origin-destination pairs are valid.  In a
large network problem, the inefficiency of this approach could lead to
major performance issues.  Handling this efficiently can require
complex data structures.

<P>
The Gurobi Python interface has been designed to make the issues we've
just described quite easy to manage.  We'll present a specific example
of how this is done shortly.  Before we do, though, we'll need to
describe a few important constructs: <EM>lists</EM>, <EM>tuples</EM>,
<EM>dictionaries</EM>, <EM>list comprehension</EM>, and the
<EM>tuplelist</EM> class.  The first four are standard Python concepts
that are particularly important in our interface, while the last is a
custom class that we've added to the Gurobi Python interface.

<P>
A quick reminder: you can consult the <A NAME="tex2html30"
  HREF="http://docs.python.org/release/2.7.2/tutorial/datastructures.html">online Python
  documentation</A>
for additional information on any of the Python data structures
mentioned here.

<P>
<B>Lists and Tuples</B>

<P>
The <EM>list</EM> data structure is central to most Python programs;
Gurobi Python programs are no exception.  We'll also rely heavily on a
similar data structure, the <EM>tuple</EM>.  Tuples are crucial to
providing efficient and convenient access to Gurobi decision variables
in Gurobi Python programs.  The difference between a list and a tuple
is subtle but important.  We'll discuss it shortly.

<P>
Lists and tuples are both simply ordered collections of Python
objects.  A list is created and displayed as a comma-separated
list of member objects, enclosed in square brackets.  A tuple is
similar, except that the member objects are enclosed in parenthesis.
For example, <EM>[1, 2, 3]</EM> is a list, while
<EM>(1, 2, 3)</EM> is a tuple.  Similarly,
<EM>['Pens', 'Denver', 'New York']</EM> is a list,
while
<EM>('Pens', 'Denver', 'New York')</EM> is a tuple.

<P>
You can retrieve individual entries from a list or tuple using
square brackets and zero-based indices:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; l = [1, 2.0, 'abc']
gurobi&gt; t = (1, 2.0, 'abc')
gurobi&gt; print l[0]
1
gurobi&gt; print t[1]
2.0
gurobi&gt; print l[2]
abc
</PRE>

<P>
What's the difference between a list and a tuple?  A tuple is
<EM>immutable</EM>, meaning that you can't modify it once it has been
created.  By contrast, you can add new members to a list, remove
members, change existing members, etc.  This immutable property
allows you to use tuples as indices for <EM>dictionaries</EM>.

<P>
<B>Dictionaries</B>

<P>
A Python <EM>dictionary</EM> allows you to map arbitrary <EM>key</EM>
values to pieces of data.  Any <EM>immutable</EM> Python object can be
used as a key: an integer, a floating-point number, a string, or even
a tuple.

<P>
To give an example, the following statements create a dictionary <EM>x</EM>,
and then associates a value <EM>1</EM> with key
<EM>('Pens', 'Denver', 'New York')</EM>
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; x = {}  # creates an empty dictionary
gurobi&gt; x[('Pens', 'Denver', 'New York')] = 1
gurobi&gt; print x[('Pens', 'Denver', 'New York')]
1
</PRE>
Python allows you to omit the parenthesis when accessing
a dictionary using a tuple, so the following is also valid:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; x = {}
gurobi&gt; x['Pens', 'Denver', 'New York'] = 2
gurobi&gt; print x['Pens', 'Denver', 'New York']
2
</PRE>
We've stored integers in the dictionary here, but dictionaries can
hold arbitrary objects.  In particular, they can hold Gurobi
decision variables:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; x['Pens', 'Denver', 'New York'] = model.addVar()
gurobi&gt; print x['Pens', 'Denver', 'New York']
&lt;gurobi.Var *Awaiting Model Update*&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
To initialize a dictionary, you can of course simply perform
assignments for each relevant key:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; values = {}
gurobi&gt; values['zero'] = 0
gurobi&gt; values['one'] = 1
gurobi&gt; values['two'] = 2
</PRE>
You can also use the Python dictionary initialization construct:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; values = { 'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2 }
gurobi&gt; print values['zero']
0
gurobi&gt; print values['one']
1
</PRE>

<P>
We have included a utility routine in the Gurobi Python interface that
simplifies dictionary initialization for a case that arises frequently
in mathematical modeling.  The <EM>multidict</EM> function allows you
to initialize one or more dictionaries in a single statement.  The
function takes a dictionary as its argument, where the value
associated with each key is a list of length <EM>n</EM>.  The function
splits these lists into individual entries, creating <EM>n</EM>
separate dictionaries.  The function returns a list.  The first
result is the list of shared key values, followed by the <EM>n</EM>
individual dictionaries:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; names, lower, upper = multidict({ 'x': [0, 1], 'y': [1, 2], 'z': [0, 3] })
gurobi&gt; print names
['x', 'y', 'z']
gurobi&gt; print lower
{'x': 0, 'y': 1, 'z': 0}
gurobi&gt; print upper
{'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}
</PRE>
Note that you can also apply this function to a dictionary where each
key maps to a scalar value.  In that case, the function simply returns
the list of keys as the first result, and the original dictionary as
the second.

<P>
You will see this function in several of our Python examples.

<P>
<B>List comprehension</B>

<P>
List comprehension is an important Python feature that allows you to
build lists in a concise fashion.  To give a simple example, the
following list comprehension builds a list containing the squares of
the numbers from 1 through 5:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; print [x*x for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
</PRE>
A list comprehension can contain more than one <EM>for</EM> clause,
and it can contain one or more <EM>if</EM> clauses.
The following example builds
a list of tuples containing all <EM>x,y</EM> pairs where x and y
are both less than 3 and are not equal:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; print [(x,y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3) if x != y]
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2) (2, 0), (2, 1)]
</PRE>
(Details on the <EM>range</EM> function can be found
<A NAME="tex2html31"
  HREF="http://docs.python.org/release/2.7.2/library/functions.html">here</A>).
List comprehension is used extensively in our Python examples.

<P>
<B>The tuplelist class</B>

<P>
The final important item we would like to discuss is the
<EM>tuplelist</EM> class.  This is a custom sub-class of the Python
<EM>list</EM> class that is designed to allow
you to efficiently build sub-lists from a list of tuples.
To be more specific, you can
use the <EM>select</EM> method on a <EM>tuplelist</EM> object to
retrieve all tuples that match one or more specified values
in specified fields.

<P>
Let us give a simple example.  We'll begin by creating a simple
<EM>tuplelist</EM> (by passing a list of tuples to the constructor):
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; l = tuplelist([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)])
</PRE>
To select a sub-list where particular tuple entries match desired
values, you specify the desired values as arguments
to the <EM>select</EM> method.
The number of arguments to <EM>select</EM> is equal
to the number of entries in the members of the <EM>tuplelist</EM>
(they should all have the same number of entries).
You use a
<EM>'*'</EM> string to indicate that any value is acceptable in that position
in the tuple.

<P>
Each tuple in our example contains two entries, so we
can perform the following selections:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; print l.select(1, '*')
[(1, 2), (1, 3)]
gurobi&gt; print l.select('*', 3)
[(1, 3), (2, 3)]
gurobi&gt; print l.select(1, 3)
[(1, 3)]
gurobi&gt; print l.select('*', '*')
[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
</PRE>

<P>
You may have noticed that similar results could have been achieved
using list comprehension.  For example:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; print l.select(1, '*')
[(1, 2), (1, 3)]
gurobi&gt; print [(x,y) for x,y in l if x == 1]
[(1, 2), (1, 3)]
</PRE>
The problem is that the latter statement considers every member in the list,
which can be quite inefficient for large lists.  The <EM>select</EM>
method builds internal data structures that make these
selections quite efficient.

<P>
Note that <EM>tuplelist</EM> is a sub-class of <EM>list</EM>, so you can
use the standard <EM>list</EM> methods to access or modify a
<EM>tuplelist</EM>:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; print l[1]
(1,3)
gurobi&gt; l += [(3, 4)]
gurobi&gt; print l
[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)]
</PRE>

<P>
Returning to our network flow example, once we've built a
<EM>tuplelist</EM> containing all valid commodity-source-destination
combinations on the network (we'll call it <EM>flows</EM>), we
can select
all arcs that flow into a specific destination city as follows:
<PRE>
gurobi&gt; inbound = flows.select('*', '*', 'New York')
</PRE>

<P>
We now present an example that illustrates the use of all of the
concepts discussed so far.

<P>
<B>netflow.py example</B>

<P>
Our example solves a multi-commodity flow model on a small network.
In the example, two commodities (Pencils and Pens) are produced in two
cities (Detroit and Denver), and must be shipped to warehouses in
three cities (Boston, New York, and Seattle) to satisfy given demand.
Each arc in the transportation network has a cost associated with it,
and a total capacity.

<P>
This is the complete source code for our example (also available in
<EM>&lt;installdir&gt;/examples/python/netflow.py</EM>)...

<P>
<PRE>
from gurobipy import *

# Model data

commodities = ['Pencils', 'Pens']
nodes = ['Detroit', 'Denver', 'Boston', 'New York', 'Seattle']

arcs, capacity = multidict({
  ('Detroit', 'Boston'):   100,
  ('Detroit', 'New York'):  80,
  ('Detroit', 'Seattle'):  120,
  ('Denver',  'Boston'):   120,
  ('Denver',  'New York'): 120,
  ('Denver',  'Seattle'):  120 })
arcs = tuplelist(arcs)

cost = {
  ('Pencils', 'Detroit', 'Boston'):   10,
  ('Pencils', 'Detroit', 'New York'): 20,
  ('Pencils', 'Detroit', 'Seattle'):  60,
  ('Pencils', 'Denver',  'Boston'):   40,
  ('Pencils', 'Denver',  'New York'): 40,
  ('Pencils', 'Denver',  'Seattle'):  30,
  ('Pens',    'Detroit', 'Boston'):   20,
  ('Pens',    'Detroit', 'New York'): 20,
  ('Pens',    'Detroit', 'Seattle'):  80,
  ('Pens',    'Denver',  'Boston'):   60,
  ('Pens',    'Denver',  'New York'): 70,
  ('Pens',    'Denver',  'Seattle'):  30 }

inflow = {
  ('Pencils', 'Detroit'):   50,
  ('Pencils', 'Denver'):    60,
  ('Pencils', 'Boston'):   -50,
  ('Pencils', 'New York'): -50,
  ('Pencils', 'Seattle'):  -10,
  ('Pens',    'Detroit'):   60,

# Create optimization model
m = Model('netflow')

# Create variables
flow = {}
for h in commodities:
    for i,j in arcs:
        flow[h,i,j] = m.addVar(ub=capacity[i,j], obj=cost[h,i,j],
                               name='flow_%s_%s_%s' % (h, i, j))
m.update()

# Arc capacity constraints
for i,j in arcs:
    m.addConstr(quicksum(flow[h,i,j] for h in commodities) &lt;= capacity[i,j],
                'cap_%s_%s' % (i, j))

# Flow conservation constraints
for h in commodities:
    for j in nodes:
        m.addConstr(
          quicksum(flow[h,i,j] for i,j in arcs.select('*',j)) +
              inflow[h,j] ==
          quicksum(flow[h,j,k] for j,k in arcs.select(j,'*')),
                   'node_%s_%s' % (h, j))

# Compute optimal solution
m.optimize()

# Print solution
if m.status == GRB.status.OPTIMAL:
    for h in commodities:
        print '\nOptimal flows for', h, ':'
        for i,j in arcs:
            if flow[h,i,j].x &gt; 0:
                print i, '-&gt;', j, ':', flow[h,i,j].x
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Example details</B>

<P>
Let us now walk through the example, line by line, to understand how
it achieves the desired result of computing the optimal network flow.
As with the simple Python example presented earlier, this example
begins by importing the Gurobi functions and classes:
<PRE>
from gurobipy import *
</PRE>

<P>
We then create a few lists that contain model data:
<PRE>
commodities = ['Pencils', 'Pens']
nodes = ['Detroit', 'Denver', 'Boston', 'New York', 'Seattle']

arcs, capacity = multidict({
  ('Detroit', 'Boston'):   100,
  ('Detroit', 'New York'):  80,
  ('Detroit', 'Seattle'):  120,
  ('Denver',  'Boston'):   120,
  ('Denver',  'New York'): 120,
  ('Denver',  'Seattle'):  120 })
arcs = tuplelist(arcs)
</PRE>
The model works with two commodities (Pencils and Pens), and the
network contains 5 nodes and 6 arcs.  We initialize <EM>commodities</EM>
and <EM>nodes</EM> as simple Python lists.  We use the Gurobi
<EM>multidict</EM> function to initialize <EM>arcs</EM> (the <EM>list</EM>
of keys) and <EM>capacity</EM> (a <EM>dictionary</EM>).

<P>
In our example, we plan to use <EM>arcs</EM> to select subsets of the
arcs when building constraints later.  We therefore pass the
<EM>list</EM> of tuples returned by <EM>multidict</EM> to the
<EM>tuplelist</EM> constructor to create a <EM>tuplelist</EM> object
instead.

<P>
The model also requires cost data for each commodity-arc pair:
<PRE>
cost = {
  ('Pencils', 'Detroit', 'Boston'):   10,
  ('Pencils', 'Detroit', 'New York'): 20,
  ('Pencils', 'Detroit', 'Seattle'):  60,
  ('Pencils', 'Denver',  'Boston'):   40,
  ('Pencils', 'Denver',  'New York'): 40,
  ('Pencils', 'Denver',  'Seattle'):  30,
  ('Pens',    'Detroit', 'Boston'):   20,
  ('Pens',    'Detroit', 'New York'): 20,
  ('Pens',    'Detroit', 'Seattle'):  80,
  ('Pens',    'Denver',  'Boston'):   60,
  ('Pens',    'Denver',  'New York'): 70,
  ('Pens',    'Denver',  'Seattle'):  30 }
</PRE>
Once this dictionary has been created, the cost of moving commodity
<EM>h</EM> from node <EM>i</EM> to <EM>j</EM> can be queried as
<EM>cost[(h,i,j)]</EM>.  Recall that Python allows you to omit the
parenthesis when using a tuple to index a dictionary, so this can be
shortened to just <EM>cost[h,i,j]</EM>.

<P>
A similar construct is used to initialize node demand data:
<PRE>
inflow = {
  ('Pencils', 'Detroit'):   50,
  ('Pencils', 'Denver'):    60,
  ('Pencils', 'Boston'):   -50,
  ('Pencils', 'New York'): -50,
  ('Pencils', 'Seattle'):  -10,
  ('Pens',    'Detroit'):   60,
  ('Pens',    'Denver'):    40,
  ('Pens',    'Boston'):   -40,
  ('Pens',    'New York'): -30,
  ('Pens',    'Seattle'):  -30 }
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Building a multi-dimensional array of variables</B>

<P>
The next step in our example (after creating an empty <EM>Model</EM>
object) is to add variables to the model.  The variables are
stored in a dictionary <EM>flow</EM>:
<PRE>
flow = {}
for h in commodities:
  for i,j in arcs:
    flow[h,i,j] = m.addVar(ub=capacity[i,j], cost=cost[h,i,j],
                           name='flow_%s_%s_%s' % (h, i, j))
m.update()
</PRE>
The <EM>flow</EM> variable is triply subscripted: by commodity, source
node, and destination node.  Note that the dictionary only contains
variables for source, destination pairs that are present in <EM>arcs</EM>.

<P>
<B>Arc capacity constraints</B>

<P>
We begin with a straightforward set of constraints.  The sum of the
flow variables on an arc must be less than or equal to the capacity of
that arc:
<PRE>
for i,j in arcs:
  m.addConstr(quicksum(flow[h,i,j] for h in commodities) &lt;= capacity[i,j],
              'cap_%s_%s' % (i, j))
</PRE>
Note that we use list comprehension to build a list of all variables
associated with an arc <EM>(i,j)</EM>:
<PRE>
flow[h,i,j] for h in commodities
</PRE>
(To be precise, as we've used it here, this is actually called a <EM>generator expression</EM> in Python, but it is similar enough
to list comprehension that you can safely ignore the difference
for the purpose of understanding this example).
The result is passed into the <EM>quicksum</EM> function to create a
Gurobi linear expression that captures the sum of all of these
variables.  The Gurobi <EM>quicksum</EM> function is an alternative to the
Python <EM>sum</EM> function that is much faster for building large
expressions.

<P>
<B>Flow conservation constraints</B>

<P>
The next set of constraints are the flow conservation constraints.  They
require that, for each commodity and node, the sum of the flow into
the node plus the quantity of external inflow at that node must be equal
to the sum of the flow out of the node:
<PRE>
for h in commodities:
  for j in nodes:
    m.addConstr(
      quicksum(flow[h,i,j] for i,j in arcs.select('*',j)) + inflow[h,j] ==
      quicksum(flow[h,j,k] for j,k in arcs.select(j,'*')),
               'node_%s_%s' % (h, j))
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Results</B>

<P>
Once we've added the model constraints, we call <EM>optimize</EM> and
then output the optimal solution:
<PRE>
if m.status == GRB.status.OPTIMAL:
  for h in commodities:
    print '\nOptimal flows for', h, ':'
    for i,j in arcs:
      if flow[h,i,j].x &gt; 0:
        print i, '-&gt;', j, ':', flow[h,i,j].x
</PRE>

<P>
If you run the example (<EM>gurobi.bat netflow.py</EM> on Windows,
or <EM>gurobi.sh netflow.py</EM> on Linux and Mac), you should
see the following output:
<PRE>
