C Interface
</H1>

<P>
This section will work through a simple C example in order to
illustrate the use of the Gurobi C interface.  The example builds a
simple Mixed Integer Programming model, optimizes it, and outputs the
optimal objective value.  This section assumes that you are already
familiar with the C programming language.  If not, a variety of books
are available for learning the language (for example,
<EM>The C Programming Language</EM>, by Kernighan and Ritchie).

<P>
Our example optimizes the following model:

</PRE>

<P>
<B>Example details</B>

<P>
Let us now walk through the example, line by line, to understand how
it achieves the desired result of optimizing the indicated model.

<P>
The example begins by including a few include files.  Gurobi C
applications should always start by including <EM>gurobi_c.h</EM>,
along with the standard C include files (<EM>stdlib.h</EM> and
<EM>stdio.h</EM>).

<P>
<B>Creating the environment</B>

<P>
After declaring the necessary program variables, the example continues
by creating an environment:
<PRE>
  error = GRBloadenv(&amp;env, "mip1.log");
  if (error || env == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: could not create environment\n");
    exit(1);
  }
</PRE>
Later attempts to create optimization models will always require an
environment, so environment creation should always be the first step
when using the Gurobi optimizer.  The second argument to
<EM>GRBloadenv()</EM> provides the name of the Gurobi log file.  If the
argument is an empty string or NULL, no log file will be written.

<P>
Note that environment creation may fail, so you should check the
return value of the call.

<P>
<B>Creating the model</B>

<P>
Once an environment has been created, the next step is to create a
model.  A Gurobi model holds a single optimization problem.  It
consists of a set of variables, a set of constraints, and the
associated attributes (variable bounds, objective coefficients,
variable integrality types, constraint senses, constraint right-hand
side values, etc.).  The first step towards building a model that
contains all of this information is to create an empty model object:
<PRE>
  /* Create an empty model */
  error = GRBnewmodel(env, &amp;model, "mip1", 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
  if (error) goto QUIT;
</PRE>
The first argument to <EM>GRBnewmodel()</EM> is the previously created
environment.  The second is a pointer to the location where the
pointer to the new model should be stored.  The third is the name of
the model.  The fourth is the number of variables to initially add to
the model.  Since we're creating an empty model, the number of initial
variables is 0.  The remaining arguments would describe the initial
variables (lower bounds, upper bounds, variable types, etc.), had they
been present.

<P>
<B>Adding variables to the model</B>

<P>
Once we create a Gurobi model, we can start adding variables and
constraints to it.  In our example, we'll begin by adding variables:
<PRE>
  /* Add variables */
  obj[0] = -1; obj[1] = -1; obj[2] = -2;
  vtype[0] = GRB_BINARY; vtype[1] = GRB_BINARY; vtype[2] = GRB_BINARY;
  error = GRBaddvars(model, 3, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, obj, NULL, NULL, vtype,
                     NULL);
</PRE>
The first argument to <EM>GRBaddvars()</EM> is the model to which the
variables are being added.  The second is the number of added
variables (3 in our example).

<P>
Arguments three through six describe the constraint matrix
coefficients associated with the new variables.  The third argument
gives the number of non-zero constraint matrix entries associated with
the new variables, and the next three arguments give details on these
non-zeros.  In our example, we'll be adding these non-zeros when we
add the constraints. Thus, the non-zero count here is zero, and the
following three arguments are all NULL.

<P>
The seventh argument to <EM>GRBaddvars()</EM> is the linear objective
coefficient for each new variable.  The default sense of the objective
is minimization, so we have negated the coefficients from our
maximization objective here.  We could also have used unmodified
maximization coefficients and changed the objective sense to
maximization (by changing the <EM>ModelSense</EM> attribute of the
model).

<P>
The next two arguments specify the lower and upper bounds of the
variables, respectively.  The NULL values indicate that these
variables should take their default values (0.0 and 1.0 for binary
variables).

<P>
The tenth argument specifies the types of the variables.  In this
example, the variables are all binary (<EM>GRB_BINARY</EM>).

<P>
The final argument gives the names of the variables.  In this case, we
allow the variable names to take their default values
(<EM>X0, X1, and X2</EM>).

<P>
<B>Updating the model - lazy modification</B>

<P>
Model modifications in the Gurobi optimizer are done in a <EM>lazy</EM>
fashion, meaning that the effects of the modifications are not seen
immediately.  This approach makes it easier to perform a sequence of
model modifications, since the model doesn't change while it is being
modified.  However, lazy modifications do require you to manually
integrate model changes when needed.  This is done with the following
routine:
<PRE>
  /* Integrate new variables */
  error = GRBupdatemodel(model);
  if (error) goto QUIT;
</PRE>
In our example, the model would contain zero variables immediately
before the call to <EM>GRBupdatemodel()</EM>, and three immediately
after.  Later attempts to add constraints to the model without first
making this call would fail, since the model would contain no
variables.

<P>
<B>Adding constraints to the model</B>

<P>
Once the new variables are integrated into the model, the next step is
to add our two constraints.  Constraints are added through the
<EM>GRBaddconstr()</EM> routine.  To add a constraint, you must specify
several pieces of information, including the non-zero values
associated with the constraint, the constraint sense, the right-hand
side value, and the constraint name.  These are all specified as
arguments to <EM>GRBaddconstr()</EM>:
<PRE>
  /* First constraint: x + 2 y + 3 z &lt;= 4 */

  ind[0] = 0; ind[1] = 1; ind[2] = 2;
  val[0] = 1; val[1] = 2; val[2] = 3;

  error = GRBaddconstr(model, 3, ind, val, GRB_LESS_EQUAL, 4.0, NULL);
  if (error) goto QUIT;
</PRE>
The first argument of <EM>GRBaddconstr()</EM> is the model to which the
constraint is being added.  The second is the total number of non-zero
coefficients associated with the new constraint.  The next two
arguments describe the non-zeros in the new constraint.  Constraint
coefficients are specified using a list of index-value pairs, one for
each non-zero value.  In our example, the first constraint to be added
is <!-- MATH
 $x + 2y + 3z \leq 4$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$x + 2y + 3z \leq 4$"></SPAN>.  We have chosen to make <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$x$"></SPAN> the first
variable in our constraint matrix, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$y$"></SPAN> the second, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$z$"></SPAN> the third
(note that this choice is arbitrary). Given our variable ordering
choice, the index-value pairs that are required for our first
constraint are (0, 1.0), (1, 2.0), and (2, 3.0).
These pairs are placed in the <EM>ind</EM> and
<EM>val</EM> arrays.

<P>
The fifth argument to <EM>GRBaddconstr()</EM> provides the sense of the
new constraint.  Possible values are <EM>GRB_LESS_EQUAL</EM>,
<EM>GRB_GREATER_EQUAL</EM>, or <EM>GRB_EQUAL</EM>.  The sixth argument gives
the right-hand side value.  The final argument gives the name of the
constraint (we allow the constraint to take its default name here by
specifying <EM>NULL</EM> for the argument).

<P>
The second constraint is added in a similar fashion:
<PRE>
  /* Second constraint: x + y &gt;= 1 */

  ind[0] = 0; ind[1] = 1;
  val[0] = 1; val[1] = 1;

  error = GRBaddconstr(model, 2, ind, val, GRB_GREATER_EQUAL, 1.0, NULL);
  if (error) goto QUIT;
</PRE>
Note that routine <EM>GRBaddconstrs()</EM> would allow you to add both
constraints in a single call.  The arguments for this routine are much
more complex, though, without providing any significant advantages, so
we recommend that you add one constraint at a time.

<P>
<B>Optimizing the model</B>

<P>
Now that the model has been built, the next step is to optimize it:
<PRE>
  error = GRBoptimize(model);
  if (error) goto QUIT;
</PRE>
This routine performs the optimization and populates several internal
model attributes, including the status of the optimization, the
solution, etc.  Once the function returns, we can query the values of
these attributes.  In particular, we can query the status of the
optimization process by retrieving the value of the <EM>Status</EM>
attribute...
<PRE>
  error = GRBgetintattr(model, GRB_INT_ATTR_STATUS, &amp;optimstatus);
  if (error) goto QUIT;
</PRE>
The optimization status has many possible values.  An optimal solution
to the model may have been found, or the model have been determined to
be infeasible or unbounded, or the solution process may have been
interrupted.  A list of possible statuses can be found in the
<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="../refman/refman.html">Gurobi Reference Manual</A>.
For our example, we know that the model is feasible, and we haven't
modified any parameters that might cause the optimization to stop
early (e.g., a time limit), so the status will be <EM>GRB_OPTIMAL</EM>.

<P>
Another important model attribute is the value of the objective function
for the computed solution.  This is accessed through this call:
<PRE>
  error = GRBgetdoubleattr(model, GRB_DBL_ATTR_OBJVAL, &amp;objval);
  if (error) goto QUIT;
</PRE>
Note that this call would return a non-zero error result if no
solution was found for this model.

<P>
Once we know that the model was solved, we can extract the <EM>X</EM>
attribute of the model, which contains the value for each variable in
the computed solution:
<PRE>
  error = GRBgetdoublearrayattr(model, GRB_DBL_ATTR_X, 0, 3, x);
  if (error) goto QUIT;
  printf("  x=%.0f, y=%.0f, z=%.0f", x[0], x[1], x[2]);
</PRE>
This routine retrieves the values of an array-valued attribute.  The
third and fourth arguments indicate the index of the first array
element to be retrieved, and the number of elements to retrieve,
respectively.  In this example we retrieve entries 0 through 2 (i.e.,
all three of them)

<P>
<B>Error reporting</B>

<P>
We would like to point out one additional aspect of the example.
Almost all of the Gurobi methods return an error code.  The code will
typically be zero, indicating that no error was encountered, but it is
important to check the value of the code in case an error arises.

<P>
While you may want to print a specialized error code at each point
where an error may occur, the Gurobi interface provides a more
flexible facility for reporting errors.  The
<EM>GRBgeterrormsg()</EM> routine returns a textual description of
the most recent error associated with an environment:
<PRE>
  if (error) {
    printf("ERROR: %s\n", GRBgeterrormsg(env));
    exit(1);
  }
</PRE>

<P>
Once the error reporting is done, the only remaining task in our
example is to release the resources associated with our optimization
task.  In this case, we populated one model and created one
environment.  We call <EM>GRBfreemodel(model)</EM> to free the model,
and <EM>GRBfreeenv(env)</EM> to free the environment.

<P>
<B>Building and running the example</B>

<P>
To build and run the example, please refer to the files in
<EM>&lt;installdir&gt;/examples/build</EM>.  For Windows platforms, this
directory contains <EM>C_examples_2008.sln</EM> and
 <EM>C_examples_2010.sln</EM> (Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 solution
files for the C examples).
Double-clicking on the solution file will
bring up Visual Studio.  Clicking on the 'mip1_c' project, and then
selecting <EM>Run</EM> from the <EM>Build</EM> menu will compile and run
the example.  For Linux or Mac OS platforms, the
<EM>&lt;installdir&gt;/examples/build</EM> directory contains an example
Makefile.  Typing <EM>make mip1_c</EM> will build and run this
example.

<P>
The C example directory <EM>&lt;installdir&gt;/examples/c</EM> contains a
number of examples.  We encourage you to browse and modify them in
order to become more familiar with the Gurobi C interface. We
also encourage you to read the
