Academic validation troubleshooting
</H2>

<P>
While most academic domain validations proceed without issue, we've
run into a few validation issues that may require some action on your
end.

<P>
<B>No reverse DNS information</B>

<P>
If <EM>grbgetkey</EM> produces a message that looks like this...
<PRE>
  ERROR: Unable to determine hostname for IP address 234.28.234.12.
</PRE>
...it means that your machine has no reverse DNS information.  This
usually happens when you are connecting to the Internet through a DHCP
server that does NAT (network address translation) or PAT (port
address translation), but does not provide DNS information for its
clients.  The simplest way to resolve this issue is to ask your
network administrator to add a DNS entry (a <EM>PTR record</EM>, to be
more specific) for the DHCP device itself.

<P>
Note that there is unfortunately no way for us to validate your
academic license without reverse DNS information.  You can
visit <A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="http://www.gurobi.com/dns">this site</A>
to check DNS information for your IP address and to
obtain for more information about reverse DNS.

<P>
<B>Not a recognized academic domain</B>

<P>
If <EM>grbgetkey</EM> produces a message that looks like this...
<PRE>
  ERROR: your hostname (mymachine.mydomain)
  was not recognized as belonging to an academic domain.
</PRE>
...it means that your domain isn't on our academic domain list.
Please make sure you are connected to your university network.  If the
reported host name is a valid university address, please send the
specific error message you receive to <EM>support@gurobi.com</EM> and
we'll add your domain.

<P>
Connecting to your academic domain through a VPN will typically not
present a problem for validation, since the request will appear to
originate from inside your academic domain.  However, some VPNs are
configured to use <EM>split tunneling</EM>, where traffic to public
internet sites is routed through your ISP.  Split tunneling introduces
a major security hole into the private network, so it is not that
common.  If you find that your validation request is rejected when you
are connected to your VPN, you should ask your network administrator
whether the VPN can be configured to route traffic to
<EM>gurobi.com</EM> through the private network.

<P>
Some machines connect to the internet through a proxy server.
Unfortunately, such configurations are incompatible with our academic
validation process.
