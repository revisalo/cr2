How to Obtain and Install a Gurobi License
</H1>

<P>
Obtaining a new Gurobi license key involves two steps.  The first is
to create a new license on our Web site.  The second is to generate a
license key that associates the license on our Web site with your
machine.  We'll discuss each step in turn:

<P>
<B>Creating a new license</B>

<P>
The process for creating a new license depends on the license type:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Trial or academic license</B>: You can create trial or
  academic licenses yourself from our Web site.  To do so, visit either
  the <EM>Free Trial</EM> or the <EM>Free Academic</EM> tab on the
  <EM>Licenses</EM> page (under the <EM>Download</EM> menu)
  at <EM>www.gurobi.com</EM>.
  First accept the license agreement, and then click on
  <EM>Request License</EM>.
  Your new license will be visible immediately, under the
  <EM>Current</EM> tab.  You can create as many trial or
  academic licenses as you like.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Commercial licenses</B>: For commercial licenses,
  you should contact us at <EM>license@gurobi.com</EM> to arrange
  for payment.  We will contact you once payment is received, at
  which point your new licenses will be visible under the
  <EM>Current</EM> tab of the <EM>Licenses</EM> page.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Once a new license is visible under <EM>Current</EM>,
clicking on the <EM>License ID</EM> will produce a page
like the following:

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
  WIDTH="726" HEIGHT="784" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./license.png"
 ALT="Image license">

</DIV>
The next step is to associate this new license with your machine
by obtaining a <EM>License Key</EM>.

<P>
<B>Getting a license key</B>

<P>
To obtain a Gurobi license key for your machine, you'll need to run
the <EM>grbgetkey</EM> command on the machine on which you would like
to run the Gurobi Optimizer while that machine is connected to the
Internet.  If you are using a free academic license, your machine must
be connected from a recognized academic domain. Note that an Internet
connection is not required once you have obtained your license key.

<P>
The exact command to run for a specific
license is indicated at the bottom of the license page (e.g.,
<EM>grbgetkey 253e22f3-...</EM>).  We recommend that you use copy-paste to
grab the entire <EM>grbgetkey</EM> command from our Web site.  On a
Windows system, you can paste the command directly into the
Windows <EM>Search</EM> box (known as the <EM>Run</EM> box in Windows XP).
This is demonstrated in the Windows 7 example shown here:

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
  WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="183" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./startrun.png"
 ALT="Image startrun">

</DIV>
On a Linux machine, you would paste this command into a shell window.
On a Mac system, you would paste the command into a <EM>Terminal</EM>
window.

<P>
The <EM>grbgetkey</EM> program passes identifying information about
your machine back to our Web site, and the Web site responds with your
license key.  Once this exchange has occured, <EM>grbgetkey</EM> will
ask you for the name of the directory in which to store your license
key file.  You can store this file anywhere, but we recommend that you
accept the default location (by simply hitting <EM>Enter</EM>).

<P>
If you are installing a paid license and your computer isn't connected
to the Internet, we also offer a manual installation process.
You'll find manual installation instructions at the bottom
of the license page (by following the link labeled <EM>click
here for additional instructions</EM>).

<P>
<B>Where to store your license key file</B>
<A NAME="subsection:licensefilelocation"></A>
<P>
When you run the Gurobi Optimizer, it will look for the
<EM>gurobi.lic</EM> key file in three different default locations.  It
will always look in your home directory.  In
addition, on a Windows system, Gurobi Optimizer 5.0.0 will also look
in <EM>c:&#92;gurobi500</EM> and
<EM>c:&#92;gurobi50</EM>.
On a Linux system, it will also look in
<EM>/opt/gurobi500</EM> and <EM>/opt/gurobi50</EM>.
On a Mac system, it will also look in
<EM>/Library/gurobi500</EM> and <EM>/Library/gurobi50</EM>.
Note that these
default paths are absolute, so for example Gurobi will look for the
license key file in <EM>c:&#92;gurobi500</EM>, even if the
software is installed in <EM>d:&#92;gurobi500</EM>.

<P>
If you would like to store your license in a non-default location, you
must set environment variable <EM>GRB_LICENSE_FILE</EM>
to point to the license key file.  <EM>Important note: the environment
  variable should point to the license key file itself, not to the directory
  that contains the file.</EM>

<P>
On Windows systems, environment variables are created and modified
through the Control Panel.  In Windows Vista&#174; or
Windows 7, searching for <EM>Environment Variables</EM> in the Control
Panel search box will lead you to the appropriate screen.  In Windows
XP&#174;, the <EM>Environment Variables</EM> screen is
accessed through the <EM>Environment Variables</EM> button on the
<EM>Advanced</EM> tab of the <EM>System</EM> screen of the Control Panel.
If you wish to put the license key file in a non-default location, you
should add a new <EM>System variable</EM> named
<EM>GRB_LICENSE_FILE</EM>, and set it to the location of your license
file.

<P>
On Linux systems, if you choose to put the license key file in a
non-default location, you should add a line like the following to your
<EM>.bashrc</EM> file:
<PRE>
  export GRB_LICENSE_FILE=/usr/home/jones/gurobi.lic
</PRE>
For Linux <EM>csh</EM> shell users, you should add the following to
your <EM>.cshrc</EM> file:
<PRE>
  setenv GRB_LICENSE_FILE /usr/home/jones/gurobi.lic
</PRE>
You should of course set the variable to point to the actual location
of your license key file.

<P>
On Mac systems, you can set the optional <EM>GRB_LICENSE_FILE</EM>
environment variable through <EM>environment.plist</EM>, as explained
in <A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="
  https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/EnvironmentVars.html">Apple's Runtime configuration Guidelines</A>
or in <A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="
  http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html">Apple Technical Q&amp;A 1067</A>.

<P>
<B>Final steps</B>

<P>
Most users will be ready to use their licenses at this point.  The two
exceptions are those using free academic licenses, and those using
floating or single-use licenses.

<P>
If you are using a free academic license, once <EM>grbgetkey</EM> has
obtained your license key, it will proceed to an academic validation
step.  This step checks your domain name against our list of known
academic domains.  If this step doesn't succeed, please refer to
<A HREF="node3.html#subsection:troubleshooting">Validation troubleshooting</A>
for information on how to proceed.

<P>
If you are using a floating or single-use license you'll need to
<A HREF="node4.html#subsection:tokenserver">set up a Gurobi token server</A>.

<P>
<B>Testing the license</B>
<A NAME="subsection:testlicense"></A>
<P>
Once you have obtained a license key for your machine, you are ready
to launch the Gurobi shell.  On Windows systems, double-click on the
Gurobi icon on your desktop (or type <EM>gurobi.bat</EM> from a
<EM>cmd</EM> window).  On Linux or Mac OS systems, type <EM>gurobi.sh</EM>
in a <EM>Terminal</EM> window.  The shell should produce the following
output:
<PRE>
Gurobi Interactive Shell, Version 5.0.0
Copyright (c) 2012, Gurobi Optimization, Inc.
Type "help()" for help

gurobi&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using a token license, you can also verify that everything
is set up correctly using the Gurobi command-line optimizer.
The following command...
<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl --tokens
</PRE>
...will return the state of the token server, as well a list of the
clients who are currently using tokens.

<P>
You are now ready to use the Gurobi interactive interface.

<P>
Some Windows users have reported that they were unable to launch the
Gurobi shell after running the installer.  You may need
to log off and log back in again in order for the environment variable
changes made by the installer to take effect.
